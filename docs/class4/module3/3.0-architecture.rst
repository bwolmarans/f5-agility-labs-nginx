Exercise 3.0: NGINX Instance Manager Architecture
#################################################

Objective
=========

Understand how NGINX Instance Manager handles network traffic 
and communications. Learn different options for securing traffic 
externally and for agent and server communication. 

Guide
=====

NGINX Instance Manager (NIM) uses an agent and server communication path for 
managing NGINX Instances.  The ``nginx-agent`` communicates with the 
``nginx-manager`` over gRPC (TCP 443).

NIM uses ClickHouse as an analytics time-series database.
ClicHouse can be installed with NIM in the same server, or can be accessed in an external installation.

Various Automation and CI/CD pipelines can use the NIM API to perform various actions.

NIM offers options to feed data and metrics to external platforms like Prometheus and visualization tools like Grafana.
